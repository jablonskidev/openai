# OpenAI: Study Notes & Projects

## What Is This?

This repo will hold study notes and projects related to OpenAI.

I plan to:
1. Jot down notes as I learn
2. Organize those notes into a useable structure
3. Add projects

When I have more notes and projects to work with, I'll decide if it makes sense to explain concepts through hands-on projects.

## Where Are the Study Notes?
The study notes will be fairly unstructured at first, but you can [check them out](https://github.com/jablonskidev/openai/blob/main/study-notes.md).

## Where Are the Projects?
Links will be added here as I add projects.
